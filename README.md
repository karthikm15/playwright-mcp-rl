Build a performant PPO policy that learns to complete browser form tasks via the Playwright MCP server, starting with single-field submit and scaling to multi-field forms with validation and dynamic DOM changes. Train on a small set of expert demonstrations using behavior cloning, then improve generalization to unseen pages through interaction.
